"# MGF" 
This package is useful to students that are encountering Moment Generating Functions for the first time.
Its goal is to enable the user to effectively calculate the moments for the specified distributions as seen in the YouTube playlist:
"Probability Theory" from Boer Commander.
The package allows the user to specify a distribution and its parameters in the MGF_evaluator() function which will calculate the specified moment's formulas and value for the selected distribution using both the Moment Generating Functions and Cumulant Generating Functions.
